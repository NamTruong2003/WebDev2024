        <div class="content">
            <p>I have seen many people who live very frugally, refusing to travel or try out new food, just to amass wealth for their children. My uncle similarly led a frugal, minimalist life and, upon his passing, left a significant inheritance for his descendants. However, that is not the lifestyle I prefer.</p>
            <p>For me, I work to enjoy life. While I plan to leave a portion of my assets to my descendants, I primarily spend my money on myself. I invest in travel and indulge in luxury items like cars, iPhones, and the latest tech products. I also help others in need whenever possible.</p>
            <p>After more than 10 years since I established a successful career, I own a house and a car while still providing for my descendants. More importantly, I have had enriching life experiences that those focused solely on saving money and acquiring properties for their children will never have.</p>
            <p>Everyone has a different outlook on life. I believe that if you have a good income, you should spend it on yourself. Providing children with too large an inheritance can diminish their motivation, and some may squander the wealth passed down by their parents. Furthermore, once parents give away all their assets, their opinions may no longer be valued, and they might even feel like outsiders in their own children's homes.</p>
            <p>Would you live frugally to amass wealth for your children and grandchildren?</p>
